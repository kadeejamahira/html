    <h2 id="title">ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION</h2>
    <img src="/home/mahira/Downloads/environmentalpollution.png">
    <P>Environmental pollution is unwarranted disposal of mass or energy into earth's 
        natural resource pool such as water,land, or air that results in long or short-term
        detriment to the atmosphere and its ecological health to negatively impact the living
         beings and their life both quantitatively and qualitatively.</P>
    <P>Environmental Pollution occurs when there is an undesired alteration in the 
        environment that has adverse consequences on plants 
        and animals.
    Pollutants are substances that pollute the environment.
    Pollutants can be liquid, solid, or gaseous in nature.</P>
    <h4>Types of Environmental Pollution:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="/home/mahira/Downloads/Untitled.jpeg">Air pollution.</a>
            <p>Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any 
                chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics
                 of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial 
                 facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution.</p>
                </li>
        <li><a href="/home/mahira/Downloads/Untitled.png">Water pollution.</a>
            <p> Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or 
                microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body
                 of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment.</p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="/home/mahira/Downloads/images.png">Land pollution.</a>
            <p>Land pollution refers to the destruction or a decline in quality of the earth's surface 
                as a result of human actions. This could include anything from mining to agriculture to
                 building, and consequences may be intentional or unintentional. Land pollution includes 
                 legacy pollution, illegal dumping and litter.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Causes of Environmental Pollution:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Burning garbage.</li>
        <li>Acid rain.</li>
        <li>Mining.</li>
        <li>Radioactive elements.</li>
        <li>Sewage and wastewater.</li>
        <li>Wildfires.</li>
        <li>Burning of fossil fuels.</li>
        <li>Dumping of garbage onto the soil.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Solutions for Environmental Pollution:</h4>
    <p>Recycle (& then recycle properly) Implementing recycling habits into your daily
         life is one of the most effective ways to help lessen landfill waste, conserve 
         natural resources, save habitats, reduce pollution, cut down on energy consumption,
          and slow down global warming.<br>
          Driving less, in favor of public transportation, biking, or walking, helps decrease
           air pollution. Also, using cars with increased fuel efficiency or electric cars 
           that do not rely on fossil fuels can decrease the amount of pollution we are
            contributing to the atmosphere.
